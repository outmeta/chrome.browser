Google Chrome is, at the time of writing, the most-used browser on the internet. As you'd expect from the name, it's a product of the tech giant Google.

Google Chrome was first released back in 2008 when browser technology was still developing. It used all of the modern-day enhancements for the time and provided a quick and seamless experience for its users. While it started at only one percent of the market share, it eventually rose to take the position of the most-used browser in the world.

It's worth noting that Google Chrome is different from Chrome OS. The former is a web browser, while the latter is an operating system that powers an entire computer. That's why it has **"OS"** in the name; it stands for **"operating system."**
